1. Created Application 
   npm i @angular/cli@16.3.7
   ng s
   ng g c appointment-list
   ng g interface models/appointment


2. Two-way data binding for Title and Date 
    [(ngModel)]
    FormsModule


3. Created an array (interface type)
    appointments: Appointment[] = [];


4. created an interface newAppointement:Appointment 
        used this interface --> to store values from input 
        pushed this newAppointment into appointments (string intertface)


5. Showed the appointments using *ngFor (CommonModule) 
        and used -> index as i (for deleting appointment with index)


6. Achieved deleting appointment using splice method of array 


7. Used localStorage for storing the data permanently even after a session ends 
   // storing data in local storage
      localStorage.setItem("appointments", JSON.stringify(this.appointments))   


8. used ngOnInit - fo showing data stored in localStorage 
            //for showing data on page load
    let savedAppointments = localStorage.getItem("appointments");

    this.appointments = savedAppointments ? JSON.parse(savedAppointments) : [];

9. Applied bootstrap classes and finished the project 
   npm i bootstrap@5.3
   in styles.css --> @import "bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css";
